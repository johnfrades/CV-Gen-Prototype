CV Generator (Prototype 2)

BACK-END functionality


Nov 2<br>
-- added login, register and generate authentication code
-- added security on authentication code and student id, where if the student register successfully their profile, a value will be triggered on the AuthKey Schema, preventing other or future users to use again the same data.

Nov 3 <br>
-- Major change on the folder structure. I've now created a 'routes' & 'models' folder, where i put the Schema's and models on 'models' folder, and the routes on 'routes' folder. It's much more cleaner and easy to manage and maintain <br>
-- Added security on generating authentication code to students. So it will be now 1 student id = 1 authentication code <br>
-- Added a Navigation Bar from bootstrap to let know who's the student currently logged in. and added a logout function
